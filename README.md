### What I learned

After a long time without practicing HTML and CSS, i took this challenge and that help me a lot to reinforcement my little knowledge and learn new things. The section of which I am proud, was in the hover of the image in the NFT card, i found a new way to do these styles.


```css
.card-box_img--overlay{
    position: absolute;
    top: 15px;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 15px;
    height: 89%;
    width: 90%;
    opacity: 0;
    transition: .3s ease;
    background-color: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
    padding: inherit;
    border-radius: inherit;
}

.card-box_img:hover .card-box_img--overlay{
    opacity: 0.6;
}

.icon-overlay{
    color: #fff;
    font-size: 170px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    text-align: center;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
}

#icon-view{
    color: #fff;
}
```

### Continued development

I will really like continue learning about animations and transitions on CSS because it can change every web page a lot. Also iÂ´m enjoying learning new ways to do some things.

### Useful resources
